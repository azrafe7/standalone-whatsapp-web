# Standalone WhatsApp Web
Open WhatsApp Web in a standalone popup window.

# Overview
Click the extension icon to open WhatsApp Web in a standalone popup window.

WhatsApp Web will open in a clean window (i.e. without forward/back buttons or bookmarks bar), 
so you can read and write your messages distraction-free, 
and always have them available in a separate window, away from your browsing tabs.

Right-click the extension icon and select "Re-attach as tab..." from the context menu to reattach WhatsApp Web as a tab in your currently open window.
